Nabbit, Version 1.0
---------------------------------------------

This folder contains the implementation of Nabbit, a Cilk++ library
for task graph evaluation.

Currently, the library actually consists of a set of C++ header files;
thus, there are no binaries to link with.

The code is organized into the following folders:

include: The header files which make up the library.  Of these files,
  including dag_node.h should include all the other files.

sample: A simple test program which demonstrates how to use the
        library.

        1.  Define a new DAG node class, which extends from one of the
        classes defined in dag_node.h

        2.  Define an InitNode() method which performs any specific
        initialization for the node.

        3.  Define a Compute() method, which computes the value for a
        node.  This method gets called only after the Compute() for
        all children of a node have completed.

        4.  When building a static DAG, use "init_node()" to create a
        node, and "add_child" to specify the children of a node.  The
        InitNode() method gets called by the init_node() method, after
        the library performs its own initialization.

        5.  On the root node of the DAG, call "source_compute()" to
        perform the DAG evaluation.

	By having each DAG node point to a global "parameters" data
	structure for the DAG, it is possible to access global
	variables.  This approach may be a bit tedious, but it works
	ok for the simple benchmarks we have.

	
random_dag: A benchmark which constructs a random DAG.

smith_waterman: A benchmark which performs a dynamic program
                calculation with a similar recurrence as the dynamic
                program for the Smith Waterman algorithm.

arrays: Defines row-major and Morton-order 2-d arrays.  These arrays
        are used only for the code in the smith_waterman directory.

misc_tests: Some tests for the data structures defined for the library
            (linked list, dynamic array, and hash table).



The interface to the library is still changing.  Hopefully, we can
improve the interface (and possibly functionality) as we test more
applications.
